    <p>
        The development efforts around RERUM fall into four categories:
        server, API, standards, and tools.
    </p>
    <h3 id="server">Server</h3>
    <p>
        The server for our public RERUM API service is built on MongoDB/Java
        (<a href="https://github.com/CenterForDigitalHumanities/rerum_server" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a>),
        but nothing prevents the same server APIs from being implemented
        in other configurations so that users may easily initialize their own
        RERUM to which others may connect.
    </p>
    <p>
        We have toyed with projects (<a href="https://github.com/CenterForDigitalHumanities/rerum-cloud" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a>, archived)
        using NodeJS and Google Datastore. Azure, AWS and others may be developed as well.
        Database flavors may be changed for different instances to optimize
        the transactions in RERUM or increase its adoption. There are SQL and noSQL
        or even flat file structures that may be best suited to certain resource types.
    </p>
    <p>
        The current authentication implements <a target="_blank" href="https://auth0.com">Auth0</a>
        service to generate API Keys and public <code>Agent</code>s within
        RERUM. Further, RERUM currently trusts registered servers and always will. 
        These server applications will make the appropriate <code>creator</code>-type assertions 
        about the individual responsibility for each object.
    </p>
    <p>
        RERUM will pursue functionality as an authenticator for OngCDH
        applications and open it up for others. In addition to an instance of
        the Auth0 user management, the public user <code>Agent</code> provides a 
        connection between various user profiles and be used as an aggregating value for 
        attribution. It is not a goal of the Rerum ecosystem to ever become a general authenticator.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, packaging of the RERUM software will require attention. Bundlers and builders 
        may allow for custom configurations or just a simplified build for developers
        who wish to host their own instance. When these installs proliferate as hoped,
        it will also become important to spec out how they may identify each other to
        complete the graph and allow for broader queries and interconnections across
        the Internet.
    </p>

    <h3 id="api">API</h3>
    <p>
        All instances of RERUM repositories must allow for at least the core API documented on
        <a href="http://centerfordigitalhumanities.github.io/rerum_server/API.html" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-github"></i> Github</a>.
        Version 0 is currently deprecated suffering from several unconventional structures
        and a somewhat complex object structure. Version 1, currently in open release,
        standardizes the object structure, establishes versioning, and removes the model 
        requirement from the objects saved. Also, v1 prefers JSON-LD 1.1 for all transactions. 
        Designed, but not yet encoded anywhere, are extensions that provide smart services 
        for IIIF, Web Annotation, and collections. Version 2, still unimagined, should 
        focus on extending the search capabilities and accommodate interconnected
        RERUM services.
    </p>

    </a>

    <h3 id="standards">Standards</h3>
    <p>
        RERUM would not be productive without the hard work of the Web Annotation
        W3C Group and the International Image Interoperability Framework. We
        believe this is the beginning of the story and the Web Annotation model for annotation
        as description, connection, attribution, selection, aggregation, and more
        should be extended to audio, video, text, and other data formats where annotation
        and selection are improved with the implementation of an abstract digital
        surrogate. Through the democratization and productive use of annotation,
        this service intends to encourage the use of existing standards and the careful
        extension and development for better coverage of new areas of scholarship.
    </p>
    <p>
        While it would be nice for RERUM to automatically know what is new and hot,
        the real world often requires a lot of refactoring of old data and logical
        polyfills to allow for the gears of convention to match teeth with the cutting
        edge. In addition to regularly updating to include equivalents or converters
        for terms and formats that may rise and fall, the plan is to include many
        management tools as well for the regular validation, batch editing, and
        perhaps wholesale conversion of annotations.

    <h3 id="tools">Components</h3>
    <p>
        In service to the mission, tools must be supported and referenced which make
        object creation easier, more accurate, and with which more encoding is possible
        than may be the minimum required for the motivating task. Here at rerum.io,
        we intend to maintain annotated references to external tools as well as producing
        tools ourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
        Use cases or requests for new tools can be submitted on the Rerum repository
        as <a href="https://github.com/CenterForDigitalHumanities/rerum/issues?title=Request%3A%20&body=Thanks%20for%20contributing%21">issues
            <i class="fa fa-github"></i></a>.
        Individual repositories will be generated for each OngCDH tool.
    </p>
    <p>
        Collection tools are designed for users who would curate a set of digital objects
        from a variety of online resources. The goal is to produce a public user interface 
        that appears cohesive and polished while providing deep investigation and recombination. 
        Importantly, this must respect intellectual property and be non-destructive.
    </p>
    <p>
        Manifest tools are very important for smaller institutions and individuals.
        The focus in this area will be to create or reference tools that allow for
        viewing, creation, editing, and validation of <code>Manifest</code> objects.
        Our tools are web applications and services, but there is space for contributions of
        specific scripts shims and plug-ins for other applications. All tools hosted
        here will include the option to save your objects to RERUM by default.
    </p>
    <p>
        Annotation tools must be included and will become more various and specialized
        as RERUM matures. The specific challenge of a good annotation tool is not its
        ability to encode the standard Web Annotation format, but its ability to identify its
        audience and encourage the user to make scholarly decisions without technical
        effort or improper encoding. Cropping a <code>Canvas</code> image annotation
        is a very discrete act from marking illustrations, though most of the interactions
        are similar. Transcription is high on the list (OngCDH's bias), but any image
        annotation is supportable. Managing annotations is also a challenge and complete
        interfaces will be required to sensibly aggregate the records within RERUM for
        the users who use them. Traversing relationships and history will be a priority
        after simple queries are well-managed. Finally, viewing annotations out of
        context can be challenging, so small visualizations as well as code snippets
        in various front-end languages will be provided.
    </p>
    <p>
        Integration is not really a tool, but will become a list of tools within which
        resources from RERUM can be imported or referenced. These short links may provide
        the opportunity to begin a project in FromThePage using the connected Manifest
        or open an annotation management tool within a Collection at the Wellcome Library. 
        Eventually, there will be a playground for users to interact with data objects 
        in a sandbox environment and try out different tools in a shareable way.
