    <p>
        To limit the possibility of abuse without putting too many obstacles up,
        writing to the annotation store is restricted to servers (no CORS) who have
        <a href="http://store.rerum.io">registered themselves</a>. The full plans for RERUM can be found
        <a href="#/future">elsewhere on the site</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The current public RERUM service is hosted on
        a virtual server of OngCDH at Saint Louis University.
        The backend is written in Java and MongoDB, with all requests currently over
        HTTP.
    </p>
    <p>
        All read requests (GET) are open by default. To write to RERUM, you require
        a registered server that is capable of using the API correctly. It may be
        helpful to see the sample implementation of
