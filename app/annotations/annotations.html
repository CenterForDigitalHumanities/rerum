        The Story of Annotation

        The Open Annotation Collaboration broke important ground on
        08 February 2013, specifying an interoperable framework
        for creating associations between related resources, annotations,
        using a methodology that conforms to the Architecture of the World
        Wide Web.<sup>

               target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>
        </sup>
        The next year, SharedCanvas (now within IIIF), demonstrated
        how simply <abbr title="Open Annotation Collaboration">OAC</abbr> (now
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-vocab/" target="_blank">Web Annotation</a>)
        could be extended to point to complex objects.
    </p>
    <p>
        Pointing (instead of directly encoding) annotations and
        <abbr title="comments, edits, links...">annotation-like objects</abbr>
        provides benefits for scholarship by separating the resource from
        the annotation, allowing for more granular and irregular resources,
        and creating a clearer history of the academic conversation.
        By separating the resource (text, image, etc.) from the
        annotation, the original digitized resource remains pristine and
        can be located anywhere in the world. Selectors remove the need
        for every reference to be to a complete resource while also
        allowing a scholar to make a very specific annotation on a
        smaller range of the original resource, whether or not it
        has native segmentation within it. Finally, every annotation
        can be individually attributed to the asserting scholar and
        software, which encourages walking back through the
        revisions in support of ambiguity, non-destructive reuse, and 
        controversy.

        There has been a frenzy in recent years to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://web.hypothes.is/blog/annotating-ocred-pdfs/">annotate everything</a>—a
        call to apply Web Annotations to websites, pdfs, and digital images.
        The <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="iiif.io">International Image Interoperability Framework</a>
        has magnified the possibilities of annotation by including them as
        a part of the abstract containers they define as surrogates for real
        and complex objects. Though Rerum supports all types of annotations,
        it is these IIIF applications that are our primary motivator.
